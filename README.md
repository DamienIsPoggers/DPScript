# DPScript
DPScript is a fighting game framework made in unity for using a custom scripting language that are in a binary file type, similar to BBScript. 

All the binary files must be inserted into unity with the file extention ".bytes" so that unity can read the files as a text asset without trying to read the actual text.
The binary files are also made using [my custom compiler](https://github.com/DamienIsPoggers/DIPsConsoleCompiler). If you have any questions, please refer to the wiki,
